## Sanofi IDEO – Center and Balance Patient Quote Bubbles (Sep 2025)

- What changed
  - Centered the quotes grid container and constrained it to `max-width: 1200px` on large screens

  - Explicitly centered the last single bubble so left/right sides feel balanced
  - Fixed typographic quote mark before each bubble using the proper Unicode opening quote

- Why it was changed
  - The quotes felt left-heavy; user asked to center and have roughly equal weight on both sides. This creates a visually balanced, intentional composition matching the rest of the case study.

- Affected areas
  - `sanofi-ideo.css` styles for `.interactive-quotes-container`, `.quote-bubble`, and `.quote-content::before`

Why: The design process section was extremely messy and hard to follow, with inconsistent text alignment, tiny wireframes that were impossible to read, and confusing layout that didn't showcase the design work properly. The prototype videos were missing from the solution section, making it hard for viewers to understand the actual user experience. This complete redesign creates a professional, easy-to-follow narrative that properly showcases the design process while making wireframes large enough to actually see the design decisions. The addition of looping prototype videos provides immediate visual understanding of the final product.

This comprehensive redesign creates a professional, consistent visual system that properly displays all content while maintaining the cozy, warm aesthetic of the Nuuko brand. The card-based layout with color-coding makes the feedback analysis much more scannable and visually appealing.

This comprehensive fix transforms the problematic iframe into an engaging, clickable prototype preview while ensuring all card layouts are perfectly aligned and consistently styled. The new approach bypasses iframe restrictions while providing a more interactive and visually appealing prototype showcase experience.
